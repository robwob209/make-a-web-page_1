          <p>
          A web page is text document written in a language called <b>HTML</b>, or <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. People use browser to request data from servers via the Internet. The servers return the information back to the browser which interprets the data.

        Coding
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Coding happens when programmers write tex in a language that a computer can understand. We learned some simple coding using <b>HTML</b>, <b>Tags</b>, <b>Elements</b>, and <b>Attributes</b>.
          <br>
          <b>Tag</b> : A tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (for example &lt; b &gt; and a closing tag &lt; /b &gt;).Some tags do not require a closing tag (like the &lt; br &gt;, line break tag).
          They are called <em>"void''</em> tags.
          <br>
          <b>Element</b>: An element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
          <br>
          <b>Attribute</b>: An attribute is a property of an element, used to set the <em>href</em> attribute on an anchor tag. Used for making links, URL resources.

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
          Computers need to be told exactly what to do, using the correct "syntax". If you forget to close a &lt; b &gt; tag, <b> the computer will not be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold.
          It could be very frustrating and sometimes time consuming. Did I mention computers are stupid?</b>

            Developer Tools (in the Browser, like Google Chrome) have powerful feauture that will allow you to see the DOM structure of a document and it allows you to dig through the embedded block elements/boxes.

        Text Editors (for programming)
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
       Scratchpad, Codepen, and Sublime Text, are editors that programmer's use. They have many powerful features that make programming easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag and will let you see in real time the changes you've made.

        <p>
        HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements create an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

        <p>
         DOM (Document Object Model), the "tree-like structure" of an HTML page. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...
